Since this calculator is based on CDC estimates of IFR, which is based on historical data, it doesn't take into account variations in mortality per infection by new variants, nor does it take into account as-yet undiscovered pharmaceutical interventions.  \n",

    "Moreover, since infection sometimes results in chronic conditions specifically associated with worse outcomes and often results in some degree of immune \"aging\", neither of which are modelled here, this app is, barring new pharmaceutical interventions, likely to underestimate risk to some degree, and the results calculated are probably best thought of as a \"best case scenario\" for the parameters modelled.\n",

    "This calculator does, however, take into account the protective effect of previous infection - meaning it assumes that after you recover from your first infection, your risk of dying from subsequent infections is reduced by 39%.  This is based on the protective effect of infection observed thus far in the pandemic, and may once again lead to an underestimate of risk (if, for example, this effect doesn't endure, if new variants completely evade immunity, or if Antibody Dependent Enhancement becomes an issue).\n",

Since omicron, however, case reports of reinfections just months, and sometimes weeks, after recovery have become common.  If you're looking to model a variety of plausible scenarios for a future without NPIs, you might want to look at mortality estimates over a given time frame with ```infections_per_year``` set to values between 2/3 and 4."

    "This calculator works like this:  if you are relatively young and healthy, the likelihood that you'll end up dying from a covid infection is relatively small (on the order of 0.0005), and the mortality risk after $x$ number of infections is   \n",

So, for the example above, if those six infections happened over a three year period, the calculation would look like this:  \n",

Finally, notice how the risk begins creeping back up in year three as a result of the gradually increasing IFR.\n",

If you roll 3 dice, what are the chances that none of the three dice is a 6?  We know that the odds of rolling a six are 1/6 for each die rolled, but what about the odds of getting at least one 6 when you roll three dice? It turns out that the odds of getting at least one 6 when you roll three dice is equal to the sum of the following probabilities:   \n",

So, to calculate the cumulative mortality rate over three years, we multiply (1-0.0008), (1-0.00067) and (1-0.00076), and subtract the total from one      \n",
