    "This is a simple calculator that you can use to estimate your cumulative covid19 mortality risk over multiple infections spanning several years, based on current [CDC mortality estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "```**NB:** The CDC IFR estimates that this model uses are based predominantly on data from initial infections and may therefore not represent actual mortality risk for repeat infections.  In other words, as the pandemic progresses, it may be the case that, at some point, each infection predisposes an individual to worse outcomes from subsequent infections, and if this is the case, then this calculator may significantly understate risk (that is, the risk of mortality for your sixth infection may be greater than your initial risk, in which case, your actual cumulative risk for multiple infections may be much higher than that modelled here).```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell labeled **```2 - PARAMETERS```**, below, enter your current ```age```, the number of ```years``` and the number of infections per year (```infections_per_year```) to model.  For example, to model the mortality risk for a 45 year old that expects to be reinfected an average of once every 18 months over the next ten years you'd enter  \n",

Since this calculator is based on CDC estimates of IFR, which is based on historical data, it doesn't take into account variations in mortality per infection by new variants, nor does it take into account as-yet undiscovered/undeployed pharmaceutical interventions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as alluded to above, since infection sometimes results in chronic conditions specifically associated with worse outcomes and likely results in some degree of immune \"aging\", neither of which are modelled here, **this model is, barring new pharmaceutical interventions, likely to underestimate risk to some degree, perhaps quite significantly**, and the results calculated are probably best thought of as a **\"best case scenario\"** for the parameters modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculator does, however, take into account the protective effect of vaccination and/or previous infection - meaning it assumes that your risk of dying from an infection at this point in the pandemic is about 40% lower than it would have been two years ago (when most people were completely immuno-na√Øve).  This is based on the protective effect of immunity observed thus far in the pandemic, and may once again lead to an underestimate of risk (if, for example, this effect doesn't endure, if new variants completely evade immunity, or if ADE becomes an issue).\n",

    "**BUT FIRST** a note on ```infections_per_year```. Prior to omicron, it had been estimated that, owing to waning immunity and viral evolution, recovered individuals could, on average, be reinfected approximately every 18 months. Since omicron, however, case reports of reinfections just months, and sometimes weeks, after recovery have become common.  If you're looking to model a variety of plausible scenarios for a future without NPIs, you might want to look at mortality estimates over a given time frame with ```infections_per_year``` set to values between 0.25 and 2."

    "It was estimated that a quarter of the US population was infected with covid during the omicron wave. If we can expect, as a baseline scenario, similar rates of infection going forward, and similar biannual surges, then approximately 90% of the population will likely be infected **at least** once every four years. If these infections are normally distributed, however, then, more than 50% of the population can expect to be reinfected once every 18 months, and many people will be reinfected two or more times per year. Considering the withdrawal of NPIs and the normalization of mass infection, however, it is quite possible that these figures represent an underestimate. \n",

This [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5_reference.pdf) article observes that recovered covid patients lose between 0.2 and 2% brain volume after an initial infection.  I've seen a number of other studies that show similar or corroborating findings.\n",

Similarly, assuming, conservatively, that between 90 and 95% of long-covid sufferers have their symptoms resolve within 12 months, we can expect that, after ten years, a baseline of between 8.4 and 16.2% of the surviving population will suffer permanent or quasi-permanent impairment.  If, however, the prevalence of PASC increases over time as a function of damage sustained during previous infections, then these figures may significantly underestimate the long-term health risks of allowing covid to circulate.  \n",
